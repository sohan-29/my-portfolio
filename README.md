# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with React and Vite. It showcases my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Features

- Responsive design with a navigation menu that toggles on small screens.
- Sections for Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
- Built using React functional components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Fast development with Vite and hot module replacement (HMR).

## Development

To start the development server locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the app at http://localhost:3000 where you can view your changes live.

## Build and Deployment

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` folder.

You can deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.
